# Spazi Challenges

From the beginning, we decided to try new technologies, we placed a huge bet on acquire new technical skills, my personal challenge was to reach a productive point using React.js, this project was my very first time using this frontend library, had made some online courses and played with it a little bit, but nothing like a whole project.

The first challenge came when we wanted to get from a single-view-application to have more views and pages and so, make our app more complete. At this time, I had designed a really simple landing page with my basic react knowledge and CSS Flexbox paradigm, but now, the project required a login and sign up pages.

I started my research and I found a whole new world filled with possibilities that React where offering me: Routing. I have looked into deep concepts of routing in React and finally I got to show different pages without going to the backend, this was the tip of the iceberg, because for our login I would need to protect this routes and check against the backend if it was safe to show the protected routes.

Solving this issue, I had the help of my team and we worked together to find a solution for our login system and a proper way to integrate the backend and the frontend to get a safe website, we did this together and I realised the value of have collaborating teammates and the importance of good communication.
